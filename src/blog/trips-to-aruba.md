Aruba is a small island off Venezuela's coast in the southern Caribbean that is only 21 miles long. It is a very popular tropical vacation spot known for being safe, adventurous, and relaxing. I went to Aruba with family in 2019 and 2021 and would absolutely recommend it to anyone planning a trip. The beaches, activities, restauraunts, and overall atmosphere makes it hard to beat.

## Traveling

A nonstop flight to Aruba is roughly 5 hours from Logan Airport in Boston, MA. This is not too bad, considering other places like Hawaii can take upwards of 13 hours.

Once you arrive in Aruba and get through the tiny airport, you will likely take a bus to your hotel. My family chose to stay at the Marriot Stellaris resort in 2019 and, most recently, at the Hyatt Regency. Both are awesome places to stay on Palm Beach, the high-rise area of the island. Eagle Beach is adjacent and is the other primary location for resorts.

The island has a steady light breeze, and the ocean is not too warm, making the heat very tolerable. All of the beaches are incredibly well taken care of and were never overly crowded. When we weren't doing something else, we would rent a palapa and relax on the beach for most of the day. You certainly won't be disappointed if you are more of the total relaxation type of vacationer.

## Excursions

There is plenty of other stuff to do if you don't like sitting at the beach for your entire vacation. These were some of my favorites.

#### Jolly Pirate

The Jolly Pirate is one of the highest-rated cruises in Aruba, which visits three popular swimming and snorkeling spots for about four hours. There is a giant rope swing, free drinks, and good food.

#### ATV Tour

We did ATV tours both times we visited. Since the island is so small, you can explore all the major attractions. We visited an ostrich farm, Baby Beach (at the bottom of the island), the California Lighthouse (at the top), the famous natural rock bridge, and gold mine ruins. We also saw a natural cave where we could swim.

#### Horseback Riding

For a much slower-paced tour, we also tried out horseback riding. The island is very arid in certain areas, so it felt like we were in a desert at some points. We also did this on a scorching day, but eventually, we reached a beach to cool off.

#### Red Sail Sunset Cruise

The Red Sail sunset cruise is a two-hour relaxing ride along the coastline with food and drinks. This was a great way to end our trip.

#### Golfing

The extreme wind made golfing almost impossible. However, it was still a fun and unique experience. Some goats randomly came out on the fairway at one point.

## Restauraunts

The restauraunts do not disappoint in Aruba. There are so many options to choose from, but here is a list of my top choices that are all fairly close to the hotel district. I also recommend trying Balashi, a beer brewed in Aruba that is similar in taste to Corona.

- Casa Tua Pizzeria
- Giannis Restaurant
- Eduardo's Beach Shack
- Chihuahua's Fiesta & Grill
- The West Deck
- Blossoms Habachi
- El Gaucho Argentine Grill
- Lola Craft
- Sopranos Piano Bar
- Hostaria Da Vittorio
